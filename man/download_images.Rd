\description{
Downloads images based on their FLickr id. Uses the flickr.photos.getSizes
API method from the Flickr API to test whether you have permission to
download an image. See
\url{https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getSizes.html} for more
information on the API method. If permission is available the image is
downloaded and saved as a .jpeg in a given save directory.
}
\details{
Note: if this is the first function of the package and you do not enter you
API key in the arguement api_key you use you will be prompted to enter your
API key or save it using the save_key function. API keys are avialable from
\url{https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply}. Using the save_key
function will save your key as a .Rda file which can then be called to when
using any other function.
