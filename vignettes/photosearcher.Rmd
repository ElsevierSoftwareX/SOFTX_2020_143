This vignette provides an overview of the functions in R package `photosearcher`.

## Searching for photographs
The `photo_search()` function can be used to search Flickr for photographs that meet specific search criteria. For example, you could search for sightings of animals to better understand the species distribution:

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Search for photos of foxes in the UK for the year 2017
foxes <- photo_search(mindate_taken = "2017-01-01",
                      maxdate_taken = "2018-01-01",
                      text = "foxes",
                      bbox = "-12.875977,49.210420,2.636719,59.977005",
                      has_geo = TRUE)  

#Search for images of trees globally for the 1st of January 2019
trees <- photo_search(mindate_taken = "2019-01-01",
                      maxdate_taken = "2019-01-01",
                      text = "tree",
                      has_geo = TRUE)

#Search for images with text mountain and tagged lake
moutain_lake <- photo_search(mindate_taken = "2019-01-01",
                             maxdate_taken = "2019-02-01",
                             text = "mountain",
                             tags = "lake",
                             has_geo = FALSE)
```

Users can also use the `sf` package to search via a simple features layer, this can be used to find images of in a specific location for example to aid in resource management for recreational activites in english national parks.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#load shape file
national_parks <- sf::read_sf(dsn = ".\\data\\shape_file\\National_Parks_England.shp")

#Search for photos of foxes in the UK for the year 2017
parks_hiking <- photo_search(mindate_taken = "2012-01-01",
                             maxdate_taken = "2012-04-01",
                             text = "hiking",
                             sf_layer = national_parks,
                             has_geo = TRUE) 
```

When `has_geo == TRUE` only metadata about images with latitude and longitude information will be retrieved. 

Here, the images of UK foxes are plotted using `ggplot2`.

## Downloading images
The package can also download the images based of of their unique id number. You can direct the download to any save directory, if it does not exists it will be automatically created. Downloading images allows for validation of their contents. Here, we demonstrate how to download the first five images that were found using the foxes `photo_search` example, as well as for a single image.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Downloading fox images from photosearch
download_images(photo_id = foxes$id[1:5], saveDir = "Fox images")

#Download a specific images based off its id
download_images(photo_id = 48704764812)
```
The package will only download images that the owner on Flickr has granted download permission. Those without permission will not be downloaded, but will produce a warning to let know the ID numbers of those skipped. Permission to download does not automatically provide permission to use and distribute, check the photographs licence before use. The `photo_search` function provides the licence information for each image.

## Finding information on a user
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Find a users hometown
user <- user_info(user_id = "155421853@N05")

user$hometown
```

## Get the top tags for a location
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Find the tags for Southampton, UK
southampton <- location_tags(woe_id = 35356)

#Find the tags for New York state, US
new_york <- location_tags(woe_id = 	2347591)
```
The woe_id argument is a Flickr specific place identifier. A places woeID can be found using the `find_place` function or using [online tools](http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/). 

## Find a locations woeID
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find woeID for Kuala Lumpur
  kuala_lumpur <- find_place(place = "Kuala Lumpur")

  kuala_lumpaur$woeid
```

## Finding tags most associated with another tag
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find tags associated with zebra
  zebra <- related_tags(tag = "zebra")

  #Find tags most assoicated with hiking
  hiking <- related_tags(tag = "hiking")
  
  #Find tags most associated with the word church
  church <- related_tags(tag = "church")

```

## Finding Exif information about a photo
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find Exif information about a single photo
  exif_photo <- get_photoinfo(photo_id = 47259127482)
```

## Finding information on a single photo
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find information about a single photo
  single_photo <- get_photoinfo(photo_id = 47259127482)
```
